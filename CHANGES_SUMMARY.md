# Changes Summary - Splash Screen Crash Fix

## 📋 Overview
Fixed critical production crash issue where the app was crashing during the splash screen after being downloaded from Play Store.

**Version**: 1.0.1 → 1.0.2  
**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Production Build

---

## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. `app/_layout.tsx` - **CRITICAL FIX**
**Changes**:
- Added `expo-splash-screen` import and initialization
- Added `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` to prevent auto-hide
- Added `appIsReady` state to track initialization
- Added `onLayoutRootView` callback to hide splash when ready
- Coordinated font loading, chapter loading, and splash screen lifecycle
- Added comprehensive error handling

**Why**: This was the PRIMARY cause of the crash. The app was rendering before resources loaded.

### 2. `app/index.tsx` - **CRITICAL FIX**
**Changes**:
- Added `_hasHydrated` check before accessing settings
- Added loading indicator while waiting for AsyncStorage hydration
- Fixed race condition where navigation happened before store loaded
- Reduced timeout from 100ms to 50ms (more responsive)

**Why**: Prevented crashes from accessing uninitialized AsyncStorage data.

### 3. `store/settingsStore.ts` - **CRITICAL FIX**
**Changes**:
- Added `_hasHydrated` state property
- Added `setHasHydrated` function
- Added `onRehydrateStorage` callback to track when AsyncStorage is ready
- Proper Zustand persist hydration tracking

**Why**: Ensured AsyncStorage is fully loaded before app tries to read from it.

### 4. `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` - **CRITICAL FIX**
**Changes**:
- Added comprehensive ProGuard keep rules for:
  - React Native core
  - Hermes JS engine
  - react-native-reanimated
  - react-native-gesture-handler
  - AsyncStorage
  - Expo modules
  - Google Mobile Ads
- Added source map preservation for better crash reports

**Why**: Production builds minify code, breaking native module references without proper rules.

### 5. `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - **IMPROVEMENT**
**Changes**:
- Enhanced error display with Odia + English text
- Added error stack display in dev mode
- Improved error logging
- Better UX with scrollable error details
- Added user-friendly error messages

**Why**: Better error handling and debugging for production issues.

### 6. `utils/assets.ts` - **DEFENSIVE FIX**
**Changes**:
- Added try-catch around `Constants.expoConfig` reads
- Added `getAssets()` function with error handling
- Added fallback to Bengali assets if loading fails
- Better error logging

**Why**: Prevented crashes if expo-constants fails in production.

### 7. `Data/index.ts` - **DEFENSIVE FIX**
**Changes**:
- Added `getLang()` function with try-catch
- Added error handling for Constants reading
- Added fallback to Bengali data

**Why**: Prevented crashes during chapter data initialization.

### 8. `app.config.js` - **VERSION UPDATE**
**Changes**:
- Updated version from "1.0.1" to "1.0.2"

**Why**: New version for Play Store update.

### 9. `android/app/build.gradle` - **VERSION UPDATE**
**Changes**:
- Updated versionCode from 1 to 2
- Updated versionName from "1.0.1" to "1.0.2"

**Why**: Required for Play Store update to push new version.

## 🎯 Root Causes Identified

### Primary Cause: Splash Screen Management
The app wasn't using `expo-splash-screen` properly. The native splash would hide automatically before React was ready, causing:
- White screen
- Crash due to accessing uninitialized stores
- Font loading errors

### Secondary Cause: AsyncStorage Race Condition
The app tried to read `settings.onboardingCompleted` immediately, but Zustand persist hadn't finished loading from AsyncStorage yet.

### Tertiary Cause: ProGuard Obfuscation
Production builds use R8/ProGuard to minify code. Without proper keep rules, native module calls were being removed or obfuscated, causing crashes.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Splash screen now properly managed with explicit show/hide
2. ✅ AsyncStorage hydration is tracked and waited for
3. ✅ Font loading coordinated with app initialization
4. ✅ ProGuard rules protect critical native modules
5. ✅ Error boundaries catch and display errors properly
6. ✅ Asset loading has fallback error handling
7. ✅ Constants reading is defensive with try-catch
8. ✅ Version numbers updated for new release

---

## 🧪 Testing Status

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Building):
1. Review all changes
2. Test in development mode:
   ```bash
   APP_LANG=or expo start
   ```
3. Verify splash screen behavior
4. Test cold start
5. Test onboarding flow

### Build & Test:
1. Build production APK/AAB:
   ```bash
   ./build-production.sh or
   # or
   APP_LANG=or eas build --platform android --profile or
   ```
2. Install on physical device
3. Test cold start (completely close app first)
4. Test all major flows
5. Monitor logcat for any errors

### Deploy:
1. Upload to Play Store
2. Submit for review
3. Monitor crash reports
4. Watch metrics for first 24-48 hours

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Test Thoroughly**: Test on multiple devices and Android versions before Play Store upload
2. **Monitor Closely**: Watch crash reports in Play Console for first 48 hours
3. **Have Rollback Plan**: Keep previous APK/AAB in case rollback needed
4. **User Communication**: Consider release notes mentioning "Fixed startup issue"
5. **Incremental Rollout**: Consider staged rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)

---

## 🆘 If Issues Persist

If crashes still occur after this fix:

1. **Get Crash Logs**:
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep -E "FATAL|AndroidRuntime" > crash.log
   ```

2. **Check Build Output**:
   - Verify all assets are included
   - Check ProGuard mapping file
   - Verify native libraries are bundled

3. **Try Development Build First**:
   ```bash
   APP_LANG=or eas build --platform android --profile development
   ```

4. **Contact Support**:
   - Share crash logs
   - Share build logs
   - Specify device model and Android version

---

## 📈 Success Criteria

The fix is successful if:
- ✅ App opens without crashing
- ✅ Splash screen transitions smoothly
- ✅ Onboarding appears for new users
- ✅ Home screen appears for returning users
- ✅ No AsyncStorage errors in logs
- ✅ Crash-free rate >99% in Play Console
- ✅ App startup time <3 seconds
