## 🔧 What Was Fixed (Simple Version)

### Problem
App crashed immediately on opening after downloading from Play Store.

### Root Causes
1. **Splash screen wasn't managed properly** - App tried to show content before it was ready
2. **Settings loading too slow** - App tried to read settings before they loaded
3. **Missing build rules** - Production build removed important code
4. **No error handling** - Crashes weren't caught gracefully

### Solutions
1. ✅ Added proper splash screen control
2. ✅ Wait for settings to load before showing app
3. ✅ Added rules to protect important code
4. ✅ Added error handling everywhere
5. ✅ Better error messages for users

## 🚀 What To Do Next

### Step 1: Test in Development (5 minutes)
```bash
# Start the app
APP_LANG=or expo start

# Things to check:
✓ App opens without crash
✓ Splash screen shows
✓ Splash screen disappears smoothly
✓ Onboarding shows (first time) OR home screen (returning)
```

### Step 2: Build Production APK (10-20 minutes)
```bash
# Option A: Using build script
./build-production.sh or

# Option B: Using EAS directly
APP_LANG=or eas build --platform android --profile or
```

### Step 3: Test Production Build (10 minutes)
```bash
# Install on real device (not emulator!)
adb install app-release.apk

# Test these scenarios:
✓ First time open (should show onboarding)
✓ Close app completely
✓ Open again (should show home screen)
✓ Navigate to different sections
✓ Close and reopen multiple times
```

### Step 4: Upload to Play Store (15 minutes)
1. Go to Play Console
2. Create new release in Production track
3. Upload APK/AAB
4. Update release notes: "Fixed app startup crash"
5. Submit for review

### Step 5: Monitor (First 48 hours)
1. Check crash-free rate (should be >99%)
2. Check ANR rate (should be <0.5%)
3. Read user reviews
4. Monitor Play Console metrics
