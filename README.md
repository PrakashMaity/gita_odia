## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app for specific language

   ```bash
   # For Odia (default)
   npm run start:or
   
   # For Bengali
   npm run start:bn
   
   # For Hindi
   npm run start:hi
   
   # For Assamese
   npm run start:as
   ```

3. Build for production

   ```bash
   # Using build script (recommended)
   ./build-production.sh or
   
   # Or using EAS directly
   APP_LANG=or eas build --platform android --profile or
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Multi-Language Support

The app supports 4 languages, each with its own assets and data:

- **bn**: Bengali (বাংলা) - `clients/bn/`
- **or**: Odia (ଓଡ଼ିଆ) - `clients/or/`
- **hi**: Hindi (हिंदी) - `clients/hi/`
- **as**: Assamese (অসমীয়া) - `clients/as/`

Each language has its own:
- Fonts (`assets/fonts/`)
- Images (`assets/images/`)
- Chapter data (`data/`)
- Theme configuration (`theme/`)

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
